# 🔒 Security Guide

This guide covers all security aspects of deploying your Job Compatibility Portal.

## 🚨 Critical Security Checklist

### ✅ Environment Variables (Already Secure)
- [x] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- [x] All API keys are in environment variables
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in code

### ✅ Data Storage Security
- [x] File-based storage is local only
- [x] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [x] Rate limiting data is server-side only

## 🔑 API Key Security

### Current Setup (Secure)
Your API keys are properly secured:

1. **Environment Variables**: All keys are in `.env.local`
2. **Git Ignored**: `.env*` files are in `.gitignore`
3. **Server-Side Only**: Keys are never exposed to client

### Production Environment Variables

When deploying, set these in your deployment platform:

```env
# NextAuth (Generate a strong secret)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-generated-secret-key

# Google OAuth (Get from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

# OpenAI (Get from OpenAI Platform)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### How to Generate Secure Secrets

#### 1. NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```bash
# Generate a secure random string
openssl rand -base64 32
```

#### 2. Check Current Secrets
```bash
# Check if any secrets are in your code
grep -r "sk-" src/
grep -r "AIza" src/
grep -r "your-" src/
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variable Management

#### Development
- ✅ Use `.env.local` for local development
- ✅ Never commit `.env.local` to Git
- ✅ Use `.env.example` for documentation

#### Production
- ✅ Set environment variables in deployment platform
- ✅ Use strong, unique secrets
- ✅ Rotate secrets regularly

### 2. API Key Security

#### OpenAI API
- ✅ Store key in environment variables
- ✅ Monitor usage in OpenAI dashboard
- ✅ Set up billing alerts
- ✅ Use least privilege principle

#### Google OAuth
- ✅ Store credentials in environment variables
- ✅ Configure authorized redirect URIs properly
- ✅ Monitor OAuth usage

### 3. Data Security

#### File Storage
- ✅ Rate limiting data is local only
- ✅ No sensitive data in client-side code
- ✅ File uploads are processed server-side

#### User Data
- ✅ No PII stored in files
- ✅ Session data is encrypted
- ✅ Rate limiting is anonymous

### 4. Authentication Security

#### NextAuth.js
- ✅ JWT strategy for sessions
- ✅ Secure session configuration
- ✅ HTTPS required in production

#### Google OAuth
- ✅ Proper redirect URI configuration
- ✅ Secure client credentials
- ✅ Monitor authentication logs

## 🔍 Security Audit

### Code Security Check
```bash
# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "sk-" src/
grep -r "AIza" src/
grep -r "your-" src/

# Check for exposed environment variables
grep -r "process.env" src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
```

### File Permissions
```bash
# Ensure proper file permissions
chmod 600 .env.local
chmod 600 data/*.json
```

### Dependencies Security
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit
```
